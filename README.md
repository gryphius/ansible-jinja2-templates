## ansible-jinja2-templates

I've occasionally been asked during Ansible trainings whether there's a repository of example Jinja2 templates people can look at for inspiration and for learning. To my knowledge there wasn't one.

My request: please submit examples of Jinja2 templates you've used previously; even if you think they're trivial I know there are people (quite a number actually) who thirst for useful examples, trivial or complex.

I think the best would be to provide examples in individual Markdown files (as with [the example](hosts-list.md) I've made) containing data you've used, the template, and example output. If need be add an introductory note which shortly explains why you've done something this way.

Can I haz your templates pleaze?! :-)
